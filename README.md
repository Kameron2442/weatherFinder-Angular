# WeatherFinder

This Angular project is a way for me to learn and implement as many major Angular concepts/features as possible. This PWA currently lets you search for a location, add it to your saved locations, and view the location's weather. Backend is built with ASP.NET Core 3.1 and is using an Azure SQL Database. Backend repo can be found at [github.com/Kameron2442/WeatherFinderAPI.](https://github.com/Kameron2442/WeatherFinderAPI) This app also uses Geonames.org for translating location names into coordnates and open openweathermap.org for determining the weather.
