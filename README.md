# WeatherFinder

This Angular project is a way for me to learn and implement as many major Angular concepts/features as possible. This PWA currently lets you search for a location, add it to your saved locations, and view the location's weather. Geonames.org is being used for translating location names into coordnates and open openweathermap.org is used for determining the weather.
